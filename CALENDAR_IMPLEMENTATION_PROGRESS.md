## ‚úÖ Phase 3: Lead Status Alignment (COMPLETE)

### 3.1 Backend Schema Updates

### Testing Status
- ‚úÖ TypeScript compilation passes
- ‚úÖ Schema validation aligned between frontend and backend

### Notes
- The existing `LeadStatusDropdown` component already handles transitions with side effects (appointments, invoices)
